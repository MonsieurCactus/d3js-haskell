A fork has been necessary since I was unable to install with Stack and has not been active in two years.
Certainly [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) has moved on since then and this library may no longer be accurate.
My goal (despite **very limited** knowledge of Haskell) is to pick up the baton and writen a working library.

In Clojure such a interoperating library [Strokes](https://github.com/dribnet/strokes) has already been achieve and looks well-maintained.  One may look at the nice [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11210177) there.
